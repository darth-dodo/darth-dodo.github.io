### Hello, friend!

I am a Backend Engineer staying in the coastal city of Mumbai, India. I have been a part of the Indian Startup ecosystem for about 5 years working in startups across multiple domains such as Education, Ecommerce, Chat Bots, Travel and Telecom.

I primarily work with **[Ruby](https://www.ruby-lang.org/en/)/[Rails](https://rubyonrails.org/)** and **[Python](https://www.python.org/)/[Django](https://www.djangoproject.com/)** and [**RDBMS**](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Relational_database). With my professional work, I aim to solve tricky business problems using pragmatic engineering solutions. If the task requires, I can dabble with some Javascript as well.

On the side, I like learning new tech stacks or programming paradigms and get deeper into "Clean Code" paradigm. Currently, I am learning **[Elixir](https://elixir-lang.org/)/[Phoenix](https://phoenixframework.org/)** in order to explore the [Functional Programming Paradigm](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Functional_programming). I am also trying to [`grok`](https://www.urbandictionary.com/define.php?term=grok) [Golang](https://golang.org/) with a sprinkling of **[Machine Learning and Data Science using Python](https://www.python-course.eu/machine_learning.php)** thrown in.

In my free time, I mentor younger engineers (pro bono) to up their backend engineering game and help non-programmers get started with learning programming languages.

I like reading open source repos to widen my knowledge about best practices and industry trends. Some of my favorite open source repos are [Django](https://github.com/django/django), [DRF](https://github.com/encode/django-rest-framework), [Discourse](https://github.com/discourse/discourse), [Saelor](https://github.com/mirumee/saleor), [Devise](https://github.com/plataformatec/devise).

I enjoy listening to classic rock, old school metal, IDM/Ambient and synthwave. My favorite artists are [Nujabes](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TjFEHf6y7CU), [Tycho](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9kuNshckRIU) and [Iron Maiden](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xg9aQvjMS60).

Oh, I also like cooking amazing food for my loved ones! :D
