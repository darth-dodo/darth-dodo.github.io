<p>Hello, friend!</p>

I am a Backend Engineer staying in the costal city of Mumbai, India. I have been a part of the Indian Startup ecosystem for about 5 years.

I primarily work with **Ruby/Rails** and **Python/Django**. With my professional work, I aim to solve tricky business problems using pragmatic engineering solutions.

 On the side, I like learning new stack and get deeper into "Clean Code" paradigm. Currently, I am learning **Elixir/Phoenix** and Golang with a sprinkling of **Machine Learning and Data Science using Python** thrown in.

In my free time, I mentor younger engineers (pro bono) to up their backend engineering game and help non-programmers get started with learning programming languages.

I like reading open source repos to widen my knowledge about best practices and industry trends. Some of my favorite open source repos are [Django](https://github.com/django/django), [DRF](https://github.com/encode/django-rest-framework), [Discourse](https://github.com/discourse/discourse), [Saelor](https://github.com/mirumee/saleor), [Devise](https://github.com/plataformatec/devise).

Oh, I also like to cook amazing food for my loved ones! :D
